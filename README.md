## Requirements

The application should fulfill the following requirements:

- A member can be created using their name and a personal website address.
- When a member is created, all the heading (h1-h3) values are pulled in from the website to that
  members profile.
- The website url is shortened (e.g. using http://goo.gl).
- After the member has been added, I can define their friendships with other existing members.
  Friendships are bi-directional i.e. If David is a friend of Oliver, Oliver is always a friend of David as well.
- The interface should list all members with their name, short url and the number of friends.
- Viewing an actual member should display the name, website URL, shortening, website headings, and
  links to their friends' pages.
- Now, looking at Alan's profile, I want to find experts in the application who write about a certain topic and
  are not already friends of Alan.
- Results should show the path of introduction from Alan to the expert e.g. Alan wants to get introduced to
  someone who writes about 'Dog breeding'. Claudia's website has a heading tag "Dog breeding in
  Ukraine". Bart knows Alan and Claudia. An example search result would be Alan -> Bart -> Claudia ("Dog
  breeding in Ukraine").
